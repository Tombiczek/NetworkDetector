# Network Detector

## Project Overview
"Network Detector" was initiated as a potential bachelor thesis project. It was intended to explore and develop methods for detecting network properties and anomalies. The project aimed to utilize advanced algorithms and techniques to provide insights into network behaviors and security features.

## Status
As of now, I have decided to discontinue this project. The initial motivation was to develop it as part of my bachelor thesis, but due to a change in focus and academic direction, I will no longer pursue this project. This repository will remain accessible for archival purposes and as a resource for anyone interested in the concept or initial groundwork.

## Project Intent and Scope
The goal was to create a tool that could effectively detect and report on various network characteristics, including but not limited to speed, security vulnerabilities, and connectivity issues. The project was designed to cater to both academic research and practical applications, providing a foundation for further development in network analysis.
